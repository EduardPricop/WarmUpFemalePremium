      "description" : "Squats are a versatile exercise that target many of the muscles in your lower body, including your quads, hamstrings, and glutes.

You can make the first few squats easier by going down halfway. Then, you can slowly increase the difficulty so the last few repetitions are full squats.

Once you’ve warmed up, you can up the intensity by holding weights when you do your squats.

To do a squat:

Stand with your feet hip-width apart and turn your toes to face forward or out to the side slightly.
Engage your core, keep your back straight, and slowly lower your hips until your thighs are parallel with the floor.
Pause briefly with your knees over, but not beyond, your toes.
Exhale and stand back up.
Do 1 to 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps.",

Start in a standing position, with feet wider than hip-width apart. Bend your arms, and place your hands behind your head. Bend your knee as you lift one leg up. Circle that leg across your body, up toward your chest, then back down to the starting position. Repeat on the other side. Continue for 30 to 60 seconds.
      Lateral Lunge With Balance
      Stand with your feet hip-width apart, hands at your side. Take a big step to the right, then push your hips back, bending your right knee and lowering your body until your right knee is bent 90 degrees. Push back to an upright position, as you lift your knee and pull it into your chest with your arms. Continue for 30 to 60 seconds on the right side, then switch to the left.",
